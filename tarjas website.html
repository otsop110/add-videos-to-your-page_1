          <div class="content-description">
            <p>After the first unit we are familiar with concepts such as the web,
               html, urls and web applications. We know how I, my computer 
               (browser), the internet, http and servers are connected to each 
               other. We are also familiar with basic html markups. We have 
               learned how to edit text and how to add images and urls to our 
               website.
            </P>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>is made of text content (what you see)</li>
				          <li>markup (what it looks like)</li>
                  <li>references to other documents (for example images and 
                      videos)</li>
                  <li>links to other pages</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>HTML markup</h3>				          
              <p>One element consists of an opening tag, contents and a closing
                 tag.
		          </p>
            <h3>HTML attribute</h3>
              <p>consists of tag attr=value, contents and closing tag. A good 
              example is a 
              <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Hyperlink-with-HTML">hyperlink</a>.
              </p>
            <h3>Images</h3>
              <div class=image>     
              	 <img src="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/283048/283048,1284913689,1/stock-photo-very-happy-black-dog-sitting-on-green-grass-61283164.jpg." alt="happy black dog sitting on a grass">
              </div>
  		        <p>Images don't have closing tag.
  		            </p>
            <h3>White space</h3>
              <p>Text can be folded in multiple lines with break and paragraph 
                 tags.
 	            </p>
            <h3>Inline vs.block</h3>
              <p>br, img, span and a are inline elements. p, div are block 
                 elements.
              </p>

          <div class="content-title">
          New concepts
          </div>
          <div class="content-description">
            <p>Web pages are constructed of boxes. HTML provides the structure 
               to the website and CSS it`s style. Javascript provides interaction 
               to the site. We are familiar with the concepts such as DOM 
               (document object model) which provides the tree-like structure 
               to the website. We also know that developers boxify their design. 
            </P>
            <h3>Html, CSS and Javascript</h3>
              <p>Html, CSS and Javascript are all languages. Html defines the 
                 structure of your document, CSS it`s style (how the page looks 
                 like) and Javascript it`s functionalities.
              </p>
            <h3>Boxes and Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
              <p>All elements on the website are boxes and each website has a 
                 tree like structure (DOM). The "tree-like structure" comes 
                 from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside 
                 of them. This relationship can be compared to a family tree. 
                 In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested 
                 boxes. When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see 
                 a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left 
                 side of the document. The more indented an element is, the 
                 more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
              </p>
            <h3>Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
              <p>Writing code is easier with a special text editor such as 
                 Sublime. Text editors predict the tags we might want to use 
                 from the first letter and add a closing tag automatically.
              </p>
            <h3>CSS language</h3>
              <p>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It allows programmers 
                 to avoid repetition. Order matters in CSS and most specific 
                 rule applies. Rules can be defined in different places and 
                 are applied in the following order: definitions further down 
                 on the list overwrite previous ones.
              </p>
            <h3>Code, test, refine</h3>
              <p>Look for natural boxes, repeated styles and semantic elements. 
                 Then write your html. Apply the styles from biggest to smallest. 
                 Fix things.
              </p>
            <h3>Developer tools</h3>
              <p>Developer tools allow us to test changes without applying them 
                 to html. They help us to compare our code with the design 
                 mock-up. We can compare margins, color etc.
              </p>  
            <h3>Validate your code</h3>
              <p>Verify your html and css with the validator tools.
                 <br>To verify HTML: 
                 <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a><br>

        <div class="content" id="content-3">
          <div class="content-title">
          New concepts
          </div>
          <div class="content-description">
            <p>After the first session of stage 2 we are familiar with the concepts 
               such as programming languages, interpreter, Python, grammar and 
               Python expressions. I also know that my computer is fast in 
               processing cycles. Cycle is a time computer takes to do one step. 
               My computer does 2,7 billion cycles per second. One step 2.7 billion 
               times per second. In the time my computer does a cycle, light 
               travels 11.1cm.
              </P>
            <h3>Computer, program and programming</h3>
              <p>These concepts are core of computer science. Computer is a 
                 universal machine and a program will tell it what to do. It can 
                 be changed into anything imaginable by giving it step-by-step 
                 instructions i.e. writing a program. Program is very precise 
                 sequence of steps that computer needs to take in order to serve 
                 as an internet browser, server, game playing machine etc. It 
                 can do computations in a very short amount of time.
              </p>
            <h3>Programming language, Python and interpreter</h3>
              <p>We need programming languages because instructions to computers 
                 have to be clear and precise. Natural languages ambiguity and 
                 verbosity make the use of them in programming cumbersome. 
                 Natural languages can be interpreted in many ways and 
                 instructions would get very lengthy. There are many <em>programming 
                 languages</em>, and at this course we will learn Python, a high 
                 level programming language. Instead of the program running 
                 directly on our computer, the program we`ll write will be input 
                 to the Python program that will run on our machine. Python is 
                 an <em>interpreter: it runs our programs, interprets them and 
                 executes them in a language that computer understands.</em>
              </p>
            <h3>Grammar</h3>
              <p>Python has a grammar like natural languages do. It defines what 
                 strings are in the language and what is correct and what incorrect. 
              </p>
            <h3>Python expressions</h3>
              <p>A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. Expression has 
                 to be exact in order it to be correct. 
              </p>
            <h3>Variables and strings</h3>
              <p>Variables offer a means to name values. We can assign a value 
                 to a variable by adding equal sign between them. In this case 
                 equal sign means "takes the value of" unlike in an expression 
                 2+3=5 where it means "is the same as". Variables improve code 
                 readability, provide us a way to store the value of data and 
                 change the value of something. 
              </p>
              <p>Strings are separated from numbers by adding "" around them. 
                 for example "3" is read by Python as text string and 3 as number. 
                 Code 3+3 and "3"+"3" will therefore give different results. The 
                 code 3+3 would give 6 and code "3"+"3" would give "33". Find 
                 function is an efficient way to find strings in a flow of strings. 
                 Adding a place into a find function allows us to search the text 
                 after the strings we have already found.</p>
            <h3>Input, function, output</h3>
              <p>Function takes input and produces output, for example sum 
                 procedure takes numbers (or strings) as input and adds them 
                 together. Functions are made of def statement followed by the 
                 parameters in parantheses. The parameters will be replaced by 
                 values when the function is used. To use the function we give 
                 the name of it followed my the value in parantheses.
              </p>
              <p>Return statement in Python is an "action code": it tells Python 
                 exactly what to do to produce output. Without return statement 
                 interpreter will get confused and will not know what it should do.
              </p>
            <h3>If and while statements, break and or</h3>
              <p>If statement is used for conditionl execution. It evaluates the 
                expressions one by one until one is found to be true. If false, 
                the program moves to the next statement. While statement is used 
                to create loops, repeated execution, which goes on as long as 
                expression is true.
              </p>
              <p>Break statement gives a way to stop the loop.</p>
            <h3>Debugging</h3>
              <p>Debugging is essential in software engineering. Sometimes our 
                 program does not work and we have to find out why.
                <ul>
                  <li>Examine the error message - start from the last line.</li>
                  <li>Work from example code.</li>
                  <li>Make sure examples work. Sometimes they are great, but 
                      sometimes they might not be so good.</li>
                  <li>Check intermediate results by adding print statement in
                      the middle of your code.</li>
                  <li>Keep and compare old versions for review.</li>
                </ul>
            <H3>Structural data: lists and For loops</H3>
              <p>List is a new way to store data in a more structured object. As 
                 strings are sequences of characters, lists can be sequences of 
                 anything:
                <ul>
                  <li>Lists can contain strings, for example ['apple','raspberry',
                     'blackberry'].</li>
                  <li>Lists can contain numbers, for example [0,0,7].</li>
                  <li>Lists can be 'accessed' and 'sliced' just like strings.</li>
                  <li>Lists can contain strings and numbers, for example 
                      ['spy',0,0,7,'bond'].</li>
                  <li>Lists can contain other lists, for example ['a','b',[0,1,7]].</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Mutation and aliasing</h3>
              <p>Lists support mutation, which means that any member of the list 
                 can be replaced by something else. Strings in contrary are immutable.</p>
            <h3>More list operations: append, + and len</h3>
              <p>Append is a method, which mutates the old list. It adds an 
                 element at the end of the list. It's structure is the following: 
                 list.append (element).
              <br>+ adds the two lists together like this [0,1] + [2,3] --> [0,1,2,3].
              <br>Len operators output tells the number of the elements in a list.</p>

        <div class="content" id="content-4">
          <div class="content-title">
          New concepts
          </div>
          <div class="content-description">
            <p>After the stage 3 we are familiar with the following concepts: 
               built-in functions, class, class variables, inheritance, instance, 
               instance variables, method, method overriding, module, object, 
               Object Oriented Programming and Python Standard Library. 
               We know how to use the code from other programmers and modify it 
               for our own purposes to save time and effort. We also understand 
               how abstraction can help developers to keep the code simple and 
               thus avoid repetition. During the stage 3 we have constructed 
               multiple mini-projects: Take a break, Send text messages by 
               Twilio, Secret message, Profanity editor and Movie website. 
               We have also drawn squares and flowers with the turtle.</p>
            <h3>From funtions to classes</h3>
              <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is 
                 used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide 
                 modularity for your application and a high degree of code 
                 reusing. Function blocks begin with the keyword def 
                 followed by the function name and parentheses. Any input 
                 parameters or arguments should be placed within these
                 parantheses. We used different functions to build the 
                 Take a break and Twilio projects. Opening the webrowser 
                 needed us to call a function open which was found within 
                 the module webbrowser in the Python Standard Library. 
                 For projects such as the Movie website, where we wanted 
                 to introduce multiple instances with the same structure 
                 and funtionalities, using functions would not have provided 
                 an elegant coding solution. Thus a new concept of class 
                 was introduced to avoid repetition.
                 </p>
            <h3>Built-in functions</h3>
              <p>The Python interpreter has a number of functions built into 
                 it that are always available. Please find a link below, 
                 which lists and explains the contents of the Python Standard 
                 Library (different modules and functions).
                 </p>
            <h3>Object oriented programming</h3>
              <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language 
                 model organized around objects rather than "actions". In object 
                 oriented programming, programs are made out of objects that 
                 interact with one another. 
              </p>
            <h3>Object</h3>
              <p>Objects are instances of classes. 
              </p>    
            <h3>Class</h3>
              <p>A class is a blueprint or template or set of instructions to 
                 build a specific type of an object. It contains only structure 
                 and does not fill in the content. The class statement in Python 
                 creates a new class definition. Class can have both data and 
                 methods. For example in the classroom with Kunal we built a movie 
                 website and created a class 'Movie', which said that 'Movie' 
                 needs to have title and storyline, but it did not tell what the 
                 title or storyline was.
              </p> 
            <h3>Instance</h3>
              <p>An instance is a specific object built from a specific class. 
                 It is a specific copy of a class that contains all of the 
                 content. We can build several instances of one class. For 
                 example instances of class 'Movie' would be the individual 
                 films. I can for example create a movie instance called 
                 inception, with title Inception and storyline "A thief who 
                 steals corporate secrets through use of dream-sharing 
                 technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea 
                 into the mind of a CEO". 
              </p>
            <h3>Instance variables</h3>
              <p>All of the variables associated with the instance are called 
                 instance variables. They are unique to an object and can be 
                 accesed by using the self variable inside the class and the 
                 instance name outside the class. In our classroom example every 
                 film had a unique title, storyline, poster image and film 
                 trailer url.
              </p>  
            <h3>Class variables</h3>
              <p>Sometimes we need variables that we want all our instances to 
                 share. They are not specific for an instance, but for a class. 
                 These are called class variables. In our example, all of the 
                 instances, individual films, of the 'class Movie' share a 
                 class variable valid_ratings.
              </p> 
            <h3>Built-in attributes (pre-defined class variables)</h3>
              <p>Every Python class keeps following built-in attributes and they 
                 can be accessed using dot operator like any other attribute.
                <ul>
                  <li>__dict__: Dictionary containing the class's namespace.</li>
                  <li>__doc__: Class documentation string or none, if undefined.</li>
                  <li>__name__: Class name.</li>
                  <li>__module__: Module name in which the class is defined. 
                      This attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode.</li>
                  <li>__bases__: A possibly empty tuple containing the base 
                      classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base 
                      class list.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
              <p>Classes are created in hierarchies, and inheritance lets the 
                 structure and methods in one class pass down the hierarchy. Less 
                 programming is required when adding functions to complex systems. 
                 If a step is added at the bottom of a hierarchy, only the 
                 processing and data associated with that unique step must be 
                 added. Everything else above that step is inherited. Classes 
                 inherit from one another. In our example class 'Movie' had the 
                 attributes title and storyline. We could create a new class 
                 'class TVshow' with the attributes: title and season. As we can 
                 see, both classes share an attribute title. They could also 
                 share another attribute, duration. Best way to structure this 
                 code would be to create a new class called 'Video' with the 
                 attributes title and duration. Subclasses 'Movie' and 'TVShow' 
                 could then inherit from class 'Video'. Inheritance works like 
                 inheritance in the real life from a parent to a child. The child 
                 can inherit some attributes from the parent such as eye color or 
                 money, and he may also have some attributes of his own such as 
                 toys or friends.
              </p>
            <h3>Method overriding</h3>
              <p>Method overriding allows a sub-class to override a specific 
                 implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its 
                 super-classes. A subclass can give its own definition of methods 
                 but need to have the same signature as the method in its 
                 super-class. This means that when overriding a method the subclass's 
                 method has to have the same name and parameter list as the 
                 super-class' overridden method.
              </p>  
            <h3>Method and the self argument</h3>
              <p>Method is a special kind of function that is defined in a class 
                 definition. For example the method  __init__() is a special 
                 method, which is called class constructor or initialization 
                 method that Python calls when you create a new instance of the 
                 class. Other class methods are defined like normal functions 
                 with the exception that the first argument to each method is 
                 self. Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do 
                 not need to include it when you call the methods.
              </p> 
           <h3>Module</h3>
              <p>A module is a file consisting of Python code. It can define 
                 functions, classes and variables. It can also contain runnable 
                 code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier 
                 to understand and use.
              </p>
            <h3>Import, from...import</h3>
              <p>You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an 
                 import statement in some other Python source file. When the 
                 interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module 
                 if the module is present in the search path. Python's 
                 from...import statement lets you import specific attributes from 
                 a module into the current namespace.
              </p>
             <h3>Python Standard Library</h3>
              <p>Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide 
                 range of facilities. It contains numerous built-in modules that 
                 provide access to system functionality such as <em>os</em>, 
                 <em>io</em> or <em>time</em> others to internet protocols and 
                 support such as <em>webbrowser</em>, <em>urllib</em> and 
                 <em>httplib</em> or to graphical user interfaces, such as 
                 <em>turtle</em>. 
              </p>
            <h3>Abstract thinking and abstraction</h3>
              <p>Abstract thinking is conceptual or generalized thinking where 
                we move from facts of specific examples to a general 'idea'. In 
                math or physics we present the general idea as a formula and use 
                that formula to solve specific problems. In computer science 
                abstraction helps in making models that can be used and 
                re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each 
                new application. Abstraction helps developers in maintaining 
                simplicity and good structure in their code. It also helps to 
                avoid repetition. In the earlier stages we learned that html 
                defines the structure of the website and CSS defines how 
                the page looks like. Class tags in html help us in organising 
                the structure of the website. They also help us to avoid 
                repetition of the style attributes in the css file. By 
                tagging all similar objects with the same class tag in the html, 
                we only need one set of style instructions for that class 
                in the css file. All these objects will look alike on our website.
